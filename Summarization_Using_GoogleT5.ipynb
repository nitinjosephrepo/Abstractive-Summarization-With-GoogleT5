              "408    Quicken loans contacted my father while he was XXXX and was not legally supposed to sign any documents. The documents were hidden from me and I found them when my father passed away. I advised quicken loans that he passed away and they told me I could modify or refinance my fathers house. I told them the house was not worth what the amount of the loan was. I had the house appraised in XX/XX/2016 and the house appraised for {$230000.00}. When quicken loans sent someone to appraise my fathers house, they used comps that were not comperable to my fathers home. They used comps not near my dads home and homes that were for sale and did n't sell yet. I opted to do a short sale on the house, quicken loans approved the short sale as well as the va. I have had nothing but headaches since my father passed with quicken loans. They did. A loan with a man that was XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and when I asked them how they could do that, their answer was if he can sign his name he can have a mortgage. Quicken loans is the worst place and I would never recommend them to anyone. What they did to my father was a predatory loan and is illegal. I will let everyone know what they did to my father and the home that was in our family for 48 years. They would rather sell the house to a complete stranger then to his daughter. They will receive less then the $ XXXX I offered.\n",
